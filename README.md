SQL_CovidProject
Delves into the COVID-19 pandemic's data, focusing on case numbers, death tolls, and vaccination rates across various global locations. Utilizing data from the PortfolioProject..Deaths and PortfolioProject..Vaccinations tables, the analysis encompasses:

    Calculation of mortality rates to gauge the lethality of the virus.
    Assessment of infection penetration within populations.
    Identification of regions with significant outbreaks and death tolls.
    Detailed examination of vaccination trends over time.

Advanced SQL features such as Common Table Expressions (CTE), temporary tables, and views are employed to facilitate complex data manipulations and prepare the dataset for insightful analyses and visualizations.
